# My Portfolio Site

- This is my Portfolio Site. This has become my go-to location to showcase my projects, and the progress that I have made in 6 months at Galvanize. Creating a portfolio was a chance for me to dig into something new. I discovered Foundation Apps as we were getting into Angularjs, and this was great exposure to the concept of SPA. The grid system is very intuitive, it has custom angular directives, and designed/styled to just the way I want it. Managing Gulp tasks for this project was simple as Foundation-Apps generates a base template for them. Please enjoy the live site and check out other projects!
