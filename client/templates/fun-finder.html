      <p>Fun Finder was our first group project. After working independantly for the first few months, getting a group project was
        a great change of pace. I learned a lot from working with other people on the same project and how to trust one another, and
        accept ideas that are not just your own. We created an application to choose categories, make an API call to Eventful API,
        and pull in upcoming events in the city that was specified before the search. You can then filter through different events, and like
        or favorite the ones that were interesting to keep track of in your profile. No longer will anyone be bored on the weekends!
