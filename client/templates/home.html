      <p> My name is Dylan, and I am a man with a plan. I currently live in Colorado Springs, and travel up to Denver to learn from the wonderful people at Galvanize Full Stack. I am a developer with a desire to learn and a passion for doing it.

        Continual growth in life is important to me, and what better way to do that than being a developer where the information is constantly and vastly being changed. I am interested in designing and building web applications through initial stages of brainstorming, to design, to actual implementation for the best possible user experience.
