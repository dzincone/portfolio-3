    <p>Galvanize Ping Pong was inspired by the entire class wanting to play ping pong and not being able
      to keep track of matches and who is playing who. I desined this application to keep track of schedules, opponents,
      and who has won or lost. Resources used for this application were: Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, Monk, HTML, CSS, and
      Javascript. This was my first real introduction into User Authentication.
