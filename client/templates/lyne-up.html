    <p>Lyne Up is a basketball scheduling and league management application. I designed this application for
      actual production for my youth basketball league. The software that was previously used was only and
       clunky. Now it is simple, intuitive, and can hold all my data for my league. Resources used for this
       application are NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, CSS, HTML and Javascript.
