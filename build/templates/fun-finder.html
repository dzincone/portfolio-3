    <p>Our first Group Project lead to the creation of Fun Finder. Fun Finder was deisnged to pull in events from
      Eventful API based on a city that is entered for location, and categories that were selected. Once selected,
      the user can find events in the area for the upcoming month and favorite certain events. Resources used were:
      Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Eventful API.
